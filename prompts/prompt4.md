make the Golas, do not copy it form the picture. implement Goals page the boards should be 'cat1', 'cat2', 'Today Actions', 'Notes' 'Done'

the backlog page should have a backlog section for the things that been not assigned to any spring yet

I should use supabase datapase,

convert the epic and task to one type `Action'

different 'Action's may connect to different goals

ake it daynmic and use API and database , make the API now returns a these dummy data you made make make the actions connect to the goals and board name for the boards I can add 'Action' for the 'Notes' Board' I can add note

the actions in the cat1 column will be related to it, the 'Today Actions' column will have the actions for any category as a to do list, when I do these actions I will move them to the Done column
